# Changelog

## 3.8.10.48
- Fixed the Theme Settings General-tab password panel so its CSS is loaded as admin CSS rather than displayed as text.

- Child-only layout density, spacing, contrast and gallery refinements.
- Improved WooCommerce single-product template reliability where applicable.

## 3.8.10.46
- Prevents heavy legacy sector-image migrations from running synchronously in the WordPress dashboard; a resumable small-batch worker now performs repairs safely.

- Restores active-sector demo, directory and managed Blog imagery after switching child themes, with Hotel posts using hospitality imagery.

- Top-aligned and rescaled About/media rows across the shared page system.
- Reassigned demo blog, directory, hero, gallery and page media from the active child theme so sector switching cannot leave images from another industry.

- Preserved the configurable frontend password protection introduced in 3.8.10.44.

## 3.8.10.44

- Standardised the default-on frontend password gate across all 13 child themes.
- The initial frontend password is `wp@demo`; it is stored only as a WordPress password hash.
- Added enable/disable and password-change controls at Settings → Theme Settings (`/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-theme-settings`).
- Added signed 24-hour access cookies, administrator bypass, no-cache headers and safe exemptions for wp-admin, AJAX, cron, REST and XML-RPC requests.

## 3.8.10.36

## 3.8.10.38

- Keeps WordPress image metadata APIs loaded before attachment insertion to avoid `wp_generate_attachment_metadata()` fatals.

## 3.8.10.32
- Fixed realistic-media attachment creation so WordPress image-admin functions load before `wp_insert_attachment()` fires `add_attachment`.

## 3.8.10.30
- Dark-mode form and WooCommerce polish.
- Project-preview imagery and improved icon sizing.

## 3.8.10.29

- Mobile mega-menu: open and hover states now explicitly set `transform: none` at the same selector specificity as the desktop mega-menu rule, while retaining the `translate` reset.

## 3.8.10.25
- Alignment and layout cleanup: nested column containers align to the column edge, hero pagination sits inside the hero surface, client-result arrows center on card boxes, partner Swipers no longer center the entire track, empty generated paragraphs/CTA wrappers are removed, legal-page spacing is reduced, dark search titles are readable, and mobile mega-menu translate is reset.

- Partner/logo items are horizontally centred, gallery slide captions share a consistent baseline, and dark hero/proof/case metrics use readable contrast.
- Business demo strings now use the maintained Latvian JSON dictionary, child-owned patterns are translatable, and the client-results carousel includes a fourth slide so navigation has a real next state.

## 3.8.10.22

- Dark-mode contact cards explicitly use light label/value/link colours.
- Share copy-link uses the same 40px square geometry as LinkedIn, Facebook and X.

## 3.8.10.20
