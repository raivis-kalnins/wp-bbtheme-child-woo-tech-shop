# WP BBTheme Child Woo Tech Shop 3.8.10.48
Technology WooCommerce child theme. Reusable ecommerce filtering/minicart functionality remains in **WP Theme Woo Support**; this theme owns presentation and Woo page shells.

## v3.7 classic Woo customer journey

The child now routes the front end through version-safe PHP shells for:

- Shop and product taxonomy catalogue (retaining the shared AJAX filter/results layer).
- Single product through the installed WooCommerce legacy product engine.
- Basket/Cart through `WC_Shortcode_Cart`.
- Checkout and order-received through `WC_Shortcode_Checkout`.
- My Account and endpoints through `WC_Shortcode_My_Account`.

This deliberately uses the legacy templates shipped by the **installed WooCommerce version** instead of bundling stale copies. The child adds the polished tables, forms, checkout/order, account navigation, responsive behaviour and product-gallery theme support.

The latest supplied localhost DB reports WooCommerce 11.0.1 with HPOS enabled.

Run `yarn prod`. After upgrading, run **Appearance → Starter Setup → Import / Refresh Starter Website**.

### 3.8.10.46
- Dashboard-safe, resumable sector media repair; no synchronous bulk image regeneration on `admin_init`.
- Password protection controls live under **Theme Settings → General**.
- Thumbnail navigation is overlaid inside the main gallery image.
- Active-sector Blog and directory media are repaired after child-theme switching.

## SCSS structure (3.8.10.9)

Frontend styles are split into `tokens`, `tools`, `base`, `header`, `footer`, `components`, `swiper`, `motion`, `forms`, `blog`, `quality`, `sector`, `responsive` and `features`. Fluid typography uses the suite `fluid-font()` mixin and explicit viewport guards rather than `clamp()`. The generated production CSS intentionally contains no `!important` declarations.

### Build compatibility

The child build is dependency-free and works with Yarn 1.22.x as well as newer Yarn versions. No Corepack step is required. Use:

```sh
yarn prod
```

The command runs `node tools/build.mjs` and rebuilds the hashed CSS/JS manifest directly.


### 3.8.10.45
- Consistent 80/64/52px section rhythm and explicit light/dark card contrast.
- Active-theme sector media repair for demo pages, blogs, directories and galleries.
- Top-aligned About imagery plus thumbnail and modal galleries on supported directory cards and single pages.

### 3.8.10.44
- Frontend password protection is enabled by default with password `wp@demo`.
- Administrators can disable it or set a new password in **Settings → Theme Settings** at `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-theme-settings`.
- Successful visitors receive a signed access cookie valid for 24 hours by default.
- Purge full-page/server/CDN caches after changing the protection setting.

### 3.8.10.42
- Replaced demo feature icons with Tabler Icons v3.46.0 outline SVGs, sized for normal UI use and coloured from the child-theme brand token.
- Single-column imported demo rows are repaired to 12 columns at every breakpoint.
- Dark-mode demo cards use explicit dark surfaces/readable text.
- Optional frontend-only demo password protection is available in Settings → Theme Settings (default password `wp@demo`).
### 3.8.10.43
